# Hello, I'm MultipleCoffee ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Infrastructure Engineer with experience in building and managing multi-AZ structured WordPress websites, implementing Keycloak on AWS ECS, and migrating AMI on WordPress. I'm passionate about cloud technologies and always eager to take on new challenges.

## My Projects

### Multi-AZ WordPress Website

I led the build-up of a WordPress website structured across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This project involved setting up and configuring the necessary infrastructure to ensure high availability and resilience of the website. The multi-AZ structure helped to ensure that the website remained accessible even if one AZ went down.

### Keycloak on AWS ECS

I implemented Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, on AWS ECS. This project involved setting up Keycloak in a Docker container and deploying it on ECS. The implementation provided a robust and scalable authentication solution for our applications.

### AMI Migration on WordPress

I managed a project to migrate Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) on WordPress. This involved creating new AMIs, testing them with WordPress, and then transitioning from the old AMIs to the new ones. This project ensured that our WordPress installations were running on up-to-date and secure AMIs.
